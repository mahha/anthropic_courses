        "Matterport is leading the digitization and datafication of the built world. We believe the digital transformation of the built world will fundamentally change the way people interact with buildings and the physical spaces around them.\n",
        "Since its founding in 2011, Matterport’s pioneering technology has set the standard for digitizing, accessing and managing buildings, spaces and places online. Our platform’s innovative software, spatial data-driven data science, and 3D capture technology have broken down the barriers that have kept the largest asset class in the world, buildings and physical spaces, offline and underutilized for many years. We believe the digitization and datafication of the built world will continue to unlock significant operational efficiencies and property values, and that Matterport is the platform to lead this enormous global transformation.\n",
        "The world is rapidly moving from offline to online. Digital transformation has made a powerful and lasting impact across every business and industry today. According to International Data Corporation, or IDC, over $6.8 trillion of direct investments will be made on digital transformation from 2020 to 2023, the global digital transformation spending is forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion in 2026 with a five-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 16.3%, and digital twin investments are expected to have a five-year CAGR of 35.2%. With this secular shift, there is also growing demand for the built world to transition from physical to digital. Nevertheless, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain offline and undigitized. The global building stock, estimated by Savills to be $327 trillion in total property value as of 2021, remains largely offline today, and we estimate that less than 0.1% is penetrated by digital transformation.\n",
        "Matterport was among the first to recognize the increasing need for digitization of the built world and the power of spatial data, the unique details underlying buildings and spaces, in facilitating the understanding of buildings and spaces. In the past, technology advanced physical road maps to the data-rich, digital maps and location services we all rely on today. Matterport now digitizes buildings, creating a data-rich environment to vastly increase our understanding and the full potential of each and every space we capture. Just as we can instantly, at the touch of a button, learn the fastest route from one city to another or locate the nearest coffee shops, Matterport’s spatial data for buildings unlocks a rich set of insights and learnings about properties and spaces worldwide. In addition, just as the geo-spatial mapping platforms of today have opened their mapping data to industry to create new business models such as ridesharing, e-commerce, food delivery marketplaces, and even short-term rental and home sharing, open access to Matterport’s structured spatial data is enabling new opportunities and business models for hospitality, facilities management, insurance, construction, real estate and retail, among others.\n",
        "We believe the total addressable market opportunity for digitizing the built world is over $240 billion, and could be as high as $1 trillion as the market matures at scale. This is based on our analysis, modeling and understanding of the global building stock of over 4 billion properties and 20 billion spaces in the world today. With the help of artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning (“ML”) and deep learning (“DL”) technologies, we believe that, with the additional monetization opportunities from powerful spatial data-driven property insights and analytics, the total addressable market for the digitization and datafication of the built world will reach more than $1 trillion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our spatial data platform and capture of digital twins deliver value across a diverse set of industries and use cases. Large retailers can manage thousands of store locations remotely, real estate agencies can provide virtual open houses for hundreds of properties and thousands of visitors at the same time, property developers can monitor the entirety of the construction process with greater detail and speed, and insurance companies can more precisely document and evaluate claims and underwriting assessments with efficiency and precision. Matterport delivers the critical digital experience, tools and information that matter to our subscribers about properties of virtually any size, shape, and location worldwide.\n",
        "For nearly a decade, we have been growing our spatial data platform and expanding our capabilities in order to create the most detailed, accurate, and data-rich digital twins available. Moreover, our 3D reconstruction process is fully automated, allowing our solution to scale with equal precision to millions of buildings and spaces of any type, shape, and size in the world. The universal applicability of our service provides Matterport significant scale and reach across diverse verticals and any geography. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base had grown approximately 39% to over 701,000 subscribers from 503,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2021, with our digital twins reaching more than 170 countries. We have digitized more than 28 billion square feet of space across multiple industries, representing significant scale and growth over the rest of the market.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we continue to transform buildings into data worldwide, we are extending our spatial data platform to further transform property planning, development, management and intelligence for our subscribers across industries to become the de facto building and business intelligence engine for the built world. We believe the demand for spatial data and resulting insights for enterprises, businesses and institutions across industries, including real estate, architecture, engineering and construction (“AEC”), retail, insurance and government, will continue to grow rapidly.\n",
        "We believe digitization and datafication represent a tremendous greenfield opportunity for growth across this massive category and asset class. From the early stages of design and development to marketing, operations, insurance and building repair and maintenance, our platform’s software and technology provide subscribers critical tools and insights to drive cost savings, increase revenues and optimally manage their buildings and spaces. We believe that hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized utilization and operating efficiencies in the built world can be unlocked through the power of our spatial data platform. Our platform and data solutions have universal applicability across industries and building categories, giving Matterport a significant advantage as we can address the entirety of this large market opportunity and increase the value of what we believe to be the largest asset class in the world.\n",
        "With a demonstrated track record of delivering value to our subscribers, our offerings include software subscription, data licensing, services and product hardware. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base included over 24% of Fortune 1000 companies, with less than 10% of our total revenue generated from our top 10 subscribers. We expect more than 80% of our revenue to come from our software subscription and data license solutions by 2025. Our innovative 3D capture products, the Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras, have played an integral part in shaping the 3D building and property visualization ecosystem. The Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras have driven adoption of our solutions and have generated the unique high-quality and scaled data set that has enabled Cortex, our proprietary AI software engine, to become the pioneering engine for digital twin creation. With this data advantage initially spurred by the Pro2 Camera, we have developed a capture device agnostic platform that scales and can generate new building and property insights for our subscribers across industries and geographies.\n",
        "We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our gross profit decreased by $8.1 million or 14%, to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022. Our ability to retain and grow the subscription revenue generated by our existing subscribers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. We track our performance in this area by measuring our net dollar expansion rate from the same set of customers across comparable periods. Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform.\n",
        "Our Industry and Market Opportunity\n",
        "Today, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain undigitized. We estimate our current serviceable addressable market includes approximately 1.3 billion spaces worldwide, primarily from the real estate and travel and hospitality sectors. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, we are continuing to penetrate the global building stock and expand our footprint across various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management, retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. We estimate our total addressable market to be more than 4 billion buildings and 20 billion spaces globally, yielding a more than $240 billion market opportunity. We believe that as Matterport’s unique spatial data library and property data services continue to grow, this opportunity could increase to more than $1 trillion based on the size of the building stock and the untapped value creation available to buildings worldwide. The constraints created by the COVID-19 pandemic have only reinforced and accelerated the importance of our scaled 3D capture solution that we have developed for diverse industries and markets over the past decade.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our Spatial Data Platform\n",
        "Overview\n",
        "Our technology platform uses spatial data collected from a wide variety of digital capture devices to transform physical buildings and spaces into dimensionally accurate, photorealistic digital twins that provide our subscribers access to previously unavailable building information and insights.\n",
        "As a first mover in this massive market for nearly a decade, we have developed and scaled our industry-leading 3D reconstruction technology powered by Cortex, our proprietary AI-driven software engine that uses machine learning to recreate a photorealistic, 3D virtual representation of an entire building structure, including contents, equipment and furnishings. The finished product is a detailed and dynamic replication of the physical space that can be explored, analyzed and customized from a web browser on any device, including smartphones. The power to manage even large-scale commercial buildings is in the palm of each subscriber’s hands, made possible by our advanced technology and breakthrough innovations across our entire spatial data technology stack.\n",
        "Key elements of our spatial data platform include:\n",
        "•Bringing offline buildings online. Traditionally, our customers needed to conduct in-person site visits to understand and assess their buildings and spaces. While photographs and floor plans can be helpful, these forms of two-dimensional (“2D”) representation have limited information and tend to be static and rigid, and thus lack the interactive element critical to a holistic understanding of each building and space. With the AI-powered capabilities of Cortex, our proprietary AI software, representation of physical objects is no longer confined to static 2D images and physical visits can be eliminated. Cortex helps to move the buildings and spaces from offline to online and makes them accessible to our customers in real-time and on demand from anywhere. After subscribers scan their buildings, our visualization algorithms accurately infer spatial positions and depths from flat, 2D imagery captured through the scans and transform them into high- fidelity and precise digital twin models. This creates a fully automated image processing pipeline to ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality.\n",
        "•Driven by spatial data. We are a data-driven company. Each incremental capture of a space grows the richness and depth of our spatial data library. Spatial data represents the unique and idiosyncratic details that underlie and compose the buildings and spaces in the human- made environment. Cortex uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twins. We help our subscribers pinpoint the height, location and other characteristics of objects in their digital twin. Our sophisticated algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. For instance, property developers can assess the amount of natural heat and daylight coming from specific windows, retailers can ensure each store layout is up to the same level of code and brand requirements, and factories can insure machinery layouts meet specifications and location guidelines. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, our spatial data library is the clearinghouse for information about the built world.\n",
        "•Powered by AI and ML. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies effectively utilize spatial data to create a robust virtual experience that is dynamic, realistic, interactive, informative and permits multiple viewing angles. AI and ML also make costly cameras unnecessary for everyday scans—subscribers can now scan their spaces by simply tapping a button on their smartphones. As a result, Matterport is a device agnostic platform, helping us more rapidly scale and drive towards our mission of digitizing and indexing the built world.\n",
        "Our value proposition to subscribers is designed to serve the entirety of the digital building lifecycle, from design and build to maintenance and operations, promotion, sale, lease, insure, repair, restore, secure and finance. As a result, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue with our subscribers as we help them to discover opportunities to drive short- and long-term return on investment by taking their buildings and spaces from offline to online across their portfolios of properties.\n",
        "Ubiquitous Capture\n",
        "Matterport has become the standard for 3D space capture. Our technology platform empowers subscribers worldwide to quickly, easily and accurately digitize, customize and manage interactive and dimensionally accurate digital twins of their buildings and spaces.\n",
        "The Matterport platform is designed to work with a wide range of LiDAR, spherical, 3D and 360 cameras, as well as smartphones, to suit the capture needs of all of our subscribers. This provides the flexibility to capture a space of any size, scale, and complexity, at anytime and anywhere.\n",
        "•Matterport Pro3 is our newest 3D camera that scans properties faster than earlier versions to help accelerate project completion.

Developed using our proprietary spatial data captured with our Pro2 and Pro3 cameras, Cortex delivers a high degree of precision and accuracy while enabling 3D capture using everyday devices.\n",
        "Generic neural networks struggle with 3D reconstruction of the real world. Matterport-optimized networks deliver more accurate and robust results. More than just raw training data, Matterport’s datasets allow us to develop new neural network architectures and evaluate them against user behavior and real-world data in millions of situations.\n",
        "•Deep learning: Connecting and optimizing the detailed neural network data architecture of each space is key to creating robust, highly accurate 3D digital twins. Cortex evaluates and optimizes each 3D model against Matterport’s rich spatial data aggregated from millions of buildings and spaces and the human annotations of those data provided by tens of thousands of subscribers worldwide. Cortex’s evaluative abilities and its data-driven optimization of 3D reconstruction yield consistent, high-precision results across a wide array of building configurations, spaces and environments.\n",
        "•Dynamic 3D reconstruction: Creating precise 3D spatial data at scale from 2D visuals and static images requires a combination of photorealistic, detailed data from multiple viewpoints and millions of spaces that train and optimize Cortex’s neural network and learning capabilities for improved 3D reconstruction of any space. Cortex’s capabilities combined with real-time spatial alignment algorithms in our 3D capture technology create an intuitive “preview” of any work in progress, allowing subscribers to work with their content interactively and in real-time.\n",
        "•Computer vision: Cortex enables a suite of powerful features to enhance the value of digital twins. These include automatic measurements for rooms or objects in a room, automatic 2D-from-3D high-definition photo gallery creation, auto face blurring for privacy protection, custom videos, walkthroughs, auto room labeling and object recognition.\n",
        "•Advanced image processing: Matterport’s computational photography algorithms create a fully automated image processing pipeline to help ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality. Our patented technology makes 3D capture as simple as pressing a single button.

        "Matterport is leading the digitization and datafication of the built world. We believe the digital transformation of the built world will fundamentally change the way people interact with buildings and the physical spaces around them.\n",
        "Since its founding in 2011, Matterport’s pioneering technology has set the standard for digitizing, accessing and managing buildings, spaces and places online. Our platform’s innovative software, spatial data-driven data science, and 3D capture technology have broken down the barriers that have kept the largest asset class in the world, buildings and physical spaces, offline and underutilized for many years. We believe the digitization and datafication of the built world will continue to unlock significant operational efficiencies and property values, and that Matterport is the platform to lead this enormous global transformation.\n",
        "The world is rapidly moving from offline to online. Digital transformation has made a powerful and lasting impact across every business and industry today. According to International Data Corporation, or IDC, over $6.8 trillion of direct investments will be made on digital transformation from 2020 to 2023, the global digital transformation spending is forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion in 2026 with a five-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 16.3%, and digital twin investments are expected to have a five-year CAGR of 35.2%. With this secular shift, there is also growing demand for the built world to transition from physical to digital. Nevertheless, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain offline and undigitized. The global building stock, estimated by Savills to be $327 trillion in total property value as of 2021, remains largely offline today, and we estimate that less than 0.1% is penetrated by digital transformation.\n",
        "Matterport was among the first to recognize the increasing need for digitization of the built world and the power of spatial data, the unique details underlying buildings and spaces, in facilitating the understanding of buildings and spaces. In the past, technology advanced physical road maps to the data-rich, digital maps and location services we all rely on today. Matterport now digitizes buildings, creating a data-rich environment to vastly increase our understanding and the full potential of each and every space we capture. Just as we can instantly, at the touch of a button, learn the fastest route from one city to another or locate the nearest coffee shops, Matterport’s spatial data for buildings unlocks a rich set of insights and learnings about properties and spaces worldwide. In addition, just as the geo-spatial mapping platforms of today have opened their mapping data to industry to create new business models such as ridesharing, e-commerce, food delivery marketplaces, and even short-term rental and home sharing, open access to Matterport’s structured spatial data is enabling new opportunities and business models for hospitality, facilities management, insurance, construction, real estate and retail, among others.\n",
        "We believe the total addressable market opportunity for digitizing the built world is over $240 billion, and could be as high as $1 trillion as the market matures at scale. This is based on our analysis, modeling and understanding of the global building stock of over 4 billion properties and 20 billion spaces in the world today. With the help of artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning (“ML”) and deep learning (“DL”) technologies, we believe that, with the additional monetization opportunities from powerful spatial data-driven property insights and analytics, the total addressable market for the digitization and datafication of the built world will reach more than $1 trillion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our spatial data platform and capture of digital twins deliver value across a diverse set of industries and use cases. Large retailers can manage thousands of store locations remotely, real estate agencies can provide virtual open houses for hundreds of properties and thousands of visitors at the same time, property developers can monitor the entirety of the construction process with greater detail and speed, and insurance companies can more precisely document and evaluate claims and underwriting assessments with efficiency and precision. Matterport delivers the critical digital experience, tools and information that matter to our subscribers about properties of virtually any size, shape, and location worldwide.\n",
        "For nearly a decade, we have been growing our spatial data platform and expanding our capabilities in order to create the most detailed, accurate, and data-rich digital twins available. Moreover, our 3D reconstruction process is fully automated, allowing our solution to scale with equal precision to millions of buildings and spaces of any type, shape, and size in the world. The universal applicability of our service provides Matterport significant scale and reach across diverse verticals and any geography. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base had grown approximately 39% to over 701,000 subscribers from 503,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2021, with our digital twins reaching more than 170 countries. We have digitized more than 28 billion square feet of space across multiple industries, representing significant scale and growth over the rest of the market.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we continue to transform buildings into data worldwide, we are extending our spatial data platform to further transform property planning, development, management and intelligence for our subscribers across industries to become the de facto building and business intelligence engine for the built world. We believe the demand for spatial data and resulting insights for enterprises, businesses and institutions across industries, including real estate, architecture, engineering and construction (“AEC”), retail, insurance and government, will continue to grow rapidly.\n",

Our platform and data solutions have universal applicability across industries and building categories, giving Matterport a significant advantage as we can address the entirety of this large market opportunity and increase the value of what we believe to be the largest asset class in the world.\n",
        "With a demonstrated track record of delivering value to our subscribers, our offerings include software subscription, data licensing, services and product hardware. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base included over 24% of Fortune 1000 companies, with less than 10% of our total revenue generated from our top 10 subscribers. We expect more than 80% of our revenue to come from our software subscription and data license solutions by 2025. Our innovative 3D capture products, the Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras, have played an integral part in shaping the 3D building and property visualization ecosystem. The Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras have driven adoption of our solutions and have generated the unique high-quality and scaled data set that has enabled Cortex, our proprietary AI software engine, to become the pioneering engine for digital twin creation. With this data advantage initially spurred by the Pro2 Camera, we have developed a capture device agnostic platform that scales and can generate new building and property insights for our subscribers across industries and geographies.\n",
        "We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our gross profit decreased by $8.1 million or 14%, to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022. Our ability to retain and grow the subscription revenue generated by our existing subscribers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. We track our performance in this area by measuring our net dollar expansion rate from the same set of customers across comparable periods. Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform.\n",
        "Our Industry and Market Opportunity\n",
        "Today, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain undigitized. We estimate our current serviceable addressable market includes approximately 1.3 billion spaces worldwide, primarily from the real estate and travel and hospitality sectors. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, we are continuing to penetrate the global building stock and expand our footprint across various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management, retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. We estimate our total addressable market to be more than 4 billion buildings and 20 billion spaces globally, yielding a more than $240 billion market opportunity. We believe that as Matterport’s unique spatial data library and property data services continue to grow, this opportunity could increase to more than $1 trillion based on the size of the building stock and the untapped value creation available to buildings worldwide. The constraints created by the COVID-19 pandemic have only reinforced and accelerated the importance of our scaled 3D capture solution that we have developed for diverse industries and markets over the past decade.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our Spatial Data Platform\n",
        "Overview\n",
        "Our technology platform uses spatial data collected from a wide variety of digital capture devices to transform physical buildings and spaces into dimensionally accurate, photorealistic digital twins that provide our subscribers access to previously unavailable building information and insights.\n",
        "As a first mover in this massive market for nearly a decade, we have developed and scaled our industry-leading 3D reconstruction technology powered by Cortex, our proprietary AI-driven software engine that uses machine learning to recreate a photorealistic, 3D virtual representation of an entire building structure, including contents, equipment and furnishings. The finished product is a detailed and dynamic replication of the physical space that can be explored, analyzed and customized from a web browser on any device, including smartphones. The power to manage even large-scale commercial buildings is in the palm of each subscriber’s hands, made possible by our advanced technology and breakthrough innovations across our entire spatial data technology stack.\n",
        "Key elements of our spatial data platform include:\n",
        "•Bringing offline buildings online. Traditionally, our customers needed to conduct in-person site visits to understand and assess their buildings and spaces. While photographs and floor plans can be helpful, these forms of two-dimensional (“2D”) representation have limited information and tend to be static and rigid, and thus lack the interactive element critical to a holistic understanding of each building and space. With the AI-powered capabilities of Cortex, our proprietary AI software, representation of physical objects is no longer confined to static 2D images and physical visits can be eliminated. Cortex helps to move the buildings and spaces from offline to online and makes them accessible to our customers in real-time and on demand from anywhere. After subscribers scan their buildings, our visualization algorithms accurately infer spatial positions and depths from flat, 2D imagery captured through the scans and transform them into high- fidelity and precise digital twin models. This creates a fully automated image processing pipeline to ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality.\n",
        "•Driven by spatial data. We are a data-driven company. Each incremental capture of a space grows the richness and depth of our spatial data library. Spatial data represents the unique and idiosyncratic details that underlie and compose the buildings and spaces in the human- made environment. Cortex uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twins. We help our subscribers pinpoint the height, location and other characteristics of objects in their digital twin. Our sophisticated algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. For instance, property developers can assess the amount of natural heat and daylight coming from specific windows, retailers can ensure each store layout is up to the same level of code and brand requirements, and factories can insure machinery layouts meet specifications and location guidelines. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, our spatial data library is the clearinghouse for information about the built world.\n",
        "•Powered by AI and ML. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies effectively utilize spatial data to create a robust virtual experience that is dynamic, realistic, interactive, informative and permits multiple viewing angles. AI and ML also make costly cameras unnecessary for everyday scans—subscribers can now scan their spaces by simply tapping a button on their smartphones. As a result, Matterport is a device agnostic platform, helping us more rapidly scale and drive towards our mission of digitizing and indexing the built world.\n",
        "Our value proposition to subscribers is designed to serve the entirety of the digital building lifecycle, from design and build to maintenance and operations, promotion, sale, lease, insure, repair, restore, secure and finance. As a result, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue with our subscribers as we help them to discover opportunities to drive short- and long-term return on investment by taking their buildings and spaces from offline to online across their portfolios of properties.\n",
        "Ubiquitous Capture\n",
        "Matterport has become the standard for 3D space capture. Our technology platform empowers subscribers worldwide to quickly, easily and accurately digitize, customize and manage interactive and dimensionally accurate digital twins of their buildings and spaces.\n",

Capturing 3D data up to 100 meters away at less than 20 seconds per sweep, Pro3’s ultra-fast, high-precision LiDAR sensor can run for hours and takes millions of measurements in any conditions.\n",
        "•Matterport Pro2 is our proprietary 3D camera that has been used to capture millions of spaces around the world with a high degree of fidelity, precision, speed and simplicity. Capable of capturing buildings more than 500,000 square feet in size, it has become the camera of choice for many residential, commercial, industrial and large-scale properties.\n",
        "•360 Cameras. Matterport supports a selection of 360 cameras available in the market. These affordable, pocket sized devices deliver precision captures with high fidelity and are appropriate for capturing smaller homes, condos, short-term rentals, apartments, and more. The spherical lens image capture technology of these devices gives Cortex robust, detailed image data to transform panoramas into our industry-leading digital twins.\n",
        "•LEICA BLK360. Through our partnership with Leica, our 3D reconstruction technology and our AI powered software engine, Cortex, transform this powerful LiDAR camera into an ultra-precise capture device for creating Matterport digital twins. It is the solution of choice for AEC professionals when exacting precision is required.\n",
        "•Smartphone Capture. Our capture apps are commercially available for both iOS and Android. Matterport’s smartphone capture solution has democratized 3D capture, making it easy and accessible for anyone to digitize buildings and spaces with a recent iPhone device since the initial introduction of Matterport for iPhone in May 2020. In April 2021, we announced the official release of the Android Capture app, giving Android users the ability to quickly and easily capture buildings and spaces in immersive 3D. In February 2022, we launched Matterport Axis, a motorized mount that holds a smartphone and can be used with the Matterport Capture app to capture 3D digital twins of any physical space with increased speed, precision, and consistency.\n",
        "Cortex and 3D Reconstruction (the Matterport Digital Twin)\n",
        "With a spatial data library, as of December 31, 2022, of approximately 9.2 million spaces under management, representing approximately 28 billion captured square feet of space, we use our advanced ML and DL technologies to algorithmically transform the spatial data we capture into an accurate 3D digital reproduction of any physical space. This intelligent, automated 3D reconstruction is made possible by Cortex, our AI-powered software engine that includes a deep learning neural network that uses our spatial data library to understand how a building or space is divided into floors and rooms, where the doorways and openings are located, and what types of rooms are present, such that those forms are compiled and aligned with dimensional accuracy into a dynamic, photorealistic digital twin. Other components of Cortex include AI-powered computer vision technologies to identify and classify the contents inside a building or space, and object recognition technologies to identify and segment everything from furnishings and equipment to doors, windows, light fixtures, fire suppression sprinklers and fire escapes. Our highly scalable artificial intelligence platform enables our subscribers to tap into powerful, enhanced building data and insights at the click of a button.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Science Behind the Matterport Digital Twin: Cortex AI Highlights\n",
        "Matterport Runs on Cortex\n",
        "Cortex is our AI-powered software engine that includes a precision deep learning neural network to create digital twins of any building or space. Developed using our proprietary spatial data captured with our Pro2 and Pro3 cameras, Cortex delivers a high degree of precision and accuracy while enabling 3D capture using everyday devices.\n",
        "Generic neural networks struggle with 3D reconstruction of the real world. Matterport-optimized networks deliver more accurate and robust results. More than just raw training data, Matterport’s datasets allow us to develop new neural network architectures and evaluate them against user behavior and real-world data in millions of situations.\n",
        "•Deep learning: Connecting and optimizing the detailed neural network data architecture of each space is key to creating robust, highly accurate 3D digital twins. Cortex evaluates and optimizes each 3D model against Matterport’s rich spatial data aggregated from millions of buildings and spaces and the human annotations of those data provided by tens of thousands of subscribers worldwide. Cortex’s evaluative abilities and its data-driven optimization of 3D reconstruction yield consistent, high-precision results across a wide array of building configurations, spaces and environments.\n",
        "•Dynamic 3D reconstruction: Creating precise 3D spatial data at scale from 2D visuals and static images requires a combination of photorealistic, detailed data from multiple viewpoints and millions of spaces that train and optimize Cortex’s neural network and learning capabilities for improved 3D reconstruction of any space. Cortex’s capabilities combined with real-time spatial alignment algorithms in our 3D capture technology create an intuitive “preview” of any work in progress, allowing subscribers to work with their content interactively and in real-time.\n",
        "•Computer vision: Cortex enables a suite of powerful features to enhance the value of digital twins. These include automatic measurements for rooms or objects in a room, automatic 2D-from-3D high-definition photo gallery creation, auto face blurring for privacy protection, custom videos, walkthroughs, auto room labeling and object recognition.\n",
        "•Advanced image processing: Matterport’s computational photography algorithms create a fully automated image processing pipeline to help ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality. Our patented technology makes 3D capture as simple as pressing a single button. Matterport’s software and technology manage the remaining steps, including white balance and camera-specific color correction, high dynamic range tone mapping, de-noising, haze removal, sharpening, saturation and other adjustments to improve image quality.\n",
        "Spatial Data and AI-Powered Insights\n",
        "Every Matterport digital twin contains extensive information about a building, room or physical space. The data uses our AI-powered Cortex engine. In addition to the Matterport digital twin itself, our spatial data consists of precision building geometry and structural detail, building contents, fixtures and condition, along with high-definition imagery and photorealistic detail from many vantage points in a space. Cortex employs a technique we call deep spatial indexing. Deep spatial indexing uses artificial intelligence, computer vision and deep learning to identify and convey important details about each space, its structure and its contents with precision and fidelity. We have created a robust spatial data standard that enables Matterport subscribers to harness an interoperable digital system of record for any building.\n",
        "In addition to creating a highly interactive digital experience for subscribers through the construction of digital twins, we ask ourselves two questions for every subscriber: (1) what is important about their building or physical space and (2) what learnings and insights can we deliver for this space? Our AI-powered Cortex engine helps us answer these questions using our spatial data library to provide aggregated property trends and operational and valuation insights. Moreover, as the Matterport platform ecosystem continues to expand, our subscribers, partners and other third-party developers can bring their own tools to further the breadth and depth of insights they can harvest from our rich spatial data layer.\n",
        "Extensible Platform Ecosystem\n",
        "Matterport offers the largest and most accurate library of spatial data in the world, with, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 9.2 million spaces under management and approximately 28 billion captured square feet. The versatility of our spatial data platform and extensive enterprise software development kit and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) has allowed us to develop a robust global ecosystem of channels and partners that extend the Matterport value proposition by geography and vertical market.

        "Item 1. Business\n",
        "Our Company\n",
        "Matterport is leading the digitization and datafication of the built world. We believe the digital transformation of the built world will fundamentally change the way people interact with buildings and the physical spaces around them.\n",
        "Since its founding in 2011, Matterport’s pioneering technology has set the standard for digitizing, accessing and managing buildings, spaces and places online. Our platform’s innovative software, spatial data-driven data science, and 3D capture technology have broken down the barriers that have kept the largest asset class in the world, buildings and physical spaces, offline and underutilized for many years. We believe the digitization and datafication of the built world will continue to unlock significant operational efficiencies and property values, and that Matterport is the platform to lead this enormous global transformation.\n",
        "The world is rapidly moving from offline to online. Digital transformation has made a powerful and lasting impact across every business and industry today. According to International Data Corporation, or IDC, over $6.8 trillion of direct investments will be made on digital transformation from 2020 to 2023, the global digital transformation spending is forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion in 2026 with a five-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 16.3%, and digital twin investments are expected to have a five-year CAGR of 35.2%. With this secular shift, there is also growing demand for the built world to transition from physical to digital. Nevertheless, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain offline and undigitized. The global building stock, estimated by Savills to be $327 trillion in total property value as of 2021, remains largely offline today, and we estimate that less than 0.1% is penetrated by digital transformation.\n",
        "Matterport was among the first to recognize the increasing need for digitization of the built world and the power of spatial data, the unique details underlying buildings and spaces, in facilitating the understanding of buildings and spaces. In the past, technology advanced physical road maps to the data-rich, digital maps and location services we all rely on today. Matterport now digitizes buildings, creating a data-rich environment to vastly increase our understanding and the full potential of each and every space we capture. Just as we can instantly, at the touch of a button, learn the fastest route from one city to another or locate the nearest coffee shops, Matterport’s spatial data for buildings unlocks a rich set of insights and learnings about properties and spaces worldwide. In addition, just as the geo-spatial mapping platforms of today have opened their mapping data to industry to create new business models such as ridesharing, e-commerce, food delivery marketplaces, and even short-term rental and home sharing, open access to Matterport’s structured spatial data is enabling new opportunities and business models for hospitality, facilities management, insurance, construction, real estate and retail, among others.\n",
        "We believe the total addressable market opportunity for digitizing the built world is over $240 billion, and could be as high as $1 trillion as the market matures at scale. This is based on our analysis, modeling and understanding of the global building stock of over 4 billion properties and 20 billion spaces in the world today. With the help of artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning (“ML”) and deep learning (“DL”) technologies, we believe that, with the additional monetization opportunities from powerful spatial data-driven property insights and analytics, the total addressable market for the digitization and datafication of the built world will reach more than $1 trillion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our spatial data platform and capture of digital twins deliver value across a diverse set of industries and use cases. Large retailers can manage thousands of store locations remotely, real estate agencies can provide virtual open houses for hundreds of properties and thousands of visitors at the same time, property developers can monitor the entirety of the construction process with greater detail and speed, and insurance companies can more precisely document and evaluate claims and underwriting assessments with efficiency and precision. Matterport delivers the critical digital experience, tools and information that matter to our subscribers about properties of virtually any size, shape, and location worldwide.\n",
        "For nearly a decade, we have been growing our spatial data platform and expanding our capabilities in order to create the most detailed, accurate, and data-rich digital twins available. Moreover, our 3D reconstruction process is fully automated, allowing our solution to scale with equal precision to millions of buildings and spaces of any type, shape, and size in the world. The universal applicability of our service provides Matterport significant scale and reach across diverse verticals and any geography. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base had grown approximately 39% to over 701,000 subscribers from 503,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2021, with our digital twins reaching more than 170 countries. We have digitized more than 28 billion square feet of space across multiple industries, representing significant scale and growth over the rest of the market.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we continue to transform buildings into data worldwide, we are extending our spatial data platform to further transform property planning, development, management and intelligence for our subscribers across industries to become the de facto building and business intelligence engine for the built world. We believe the demand for spatial data and resulting insights for enterprises, businesses and institutions across industries, including real estate, architecture, engineering and construction (“AEC”), retail, insurance and government, will continue to grow rapidly.\n",
        "We believe digitization and datafication represent a tremendous greenfield opportunity for growth across this massive category and asset class. From the early stages of design and development to marketing, operations, insurance and building repair and maintenance, our platform’s software and technology provide subscribers critical tools and insights to drive cost savings, increase revenues and optimally manage their buildings and spaces. We believe that hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized utilization and operating efficiencies in the built world can be unlocked through the power of our spatial data platform. Our platform and data solutions have universal applicability across industries and building categories, giving Matterport a significant advantage as we can address the entirety of this large market opportunity and increase the value of what we believe to be the largest asset class in the world.\n",
        "With a demonstrated track record of delivering value to our subscribers, our offerings include software subscription, data licensing, services and product hardware. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base included over 24% of Fortune 1000 companies, with less than 10% of our total revenue generated from our top 10 subscribers. We expect more than 80% of our revenue to come from our software subscription and data license solutions by 2025. Our innovative 3D capture products, the Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras, have played an integral part in shaping the 3D building and property visualization ecosystem. The Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras have driven adoption of our solutions and have generated the unique high-quality and scaled data set that has enabled Cortex, our proprietary AI software engine, to become the pioneering engine for digital twin creation. With this data advantage initially spurred by the Pro2 Camera, we have developed a capture device agnostic platform that scales and can generate new building and property insights for our subscribers across industries and geographies.\n",
        "We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our gross profit decreased by $8.1 million or 14%, to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022. Our ability to retain and grow the subscription revenue generated by our existing subscribers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. We track our performance in this area by measuring our net dollar expansion rate from the same set of customers across comparable periods. Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform.\n",
        "Our Industry and Market Opportunity\n",
        "Today, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain undigitized. We estimate our current serviceable addressable market includes approximately 1.3 billion spaces worldwide, primarily from the real estate and travel and hospitality sectors. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, we are continuing to penetrate the global building stock and expand our footprint across various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management, retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. We estimate our total addressable market to be more than 4 billion buildings and 20 billion spaces globally, yielding a more than $240 billion market opportunity. We believe that as Matterport’s unique spatial data library and property data services continue to grow, this opportunity could increase to more than $1 trillion based on the size of the building stock and the untapped value creation available to buildings worldwide. The constraints created by the COVID-19 pandemic have only reinforced and accelerated the importance of our scaled 3D capture solution that we have developed for diverse industries and markets over the past decade.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our Spatial Data Platform\n",
        "Overview\n",
        "Our technology platform uses spatial data collected from a wide variety of digital capture devices to transform physical buildings and spaces into dimensionally accurate, photorealistic digital twins that provide our subscribers access to previously unavailable building information and insights.\n",
        "As a first mover in this massive market for nearly a decade, we have developed and scaled our industry-leading 3D reconstruction technology powered by Cortex, our proprietary AI-driven software engine that uses machine learning to recreate a photorealistic, 3D virtual representation of an entire building structure, including contents, equipment and furnishings. The finished product is a detailed and dynamic replication of the physical space that can be explored, analyzed and customized from a web browser on any device, including smartphones. The power to manage even large-scale commercial buildings is in the palm of each subscriber’s hands, made possible by our advanced technology and breakthrough innovations across our entire spatial data technology stack.\n",
        "Key elements of our spatial data platform include:\n",
        "•Bringing offline buildings online. Traditionally, our customers needed to conduct in-person site visits to understand and assess their buildings and spaces. While photographs and floor plans can be helpful, these forms of two-dimensional (“2D”) representation have limited information and tend to be static and rigid, and thus lack the interactive element critical to a holistic understanding of each building and space. With the AI-powered capabilities of Cortex, our proprietary AI software, representation of physical objects is no longer confined to static 2D images and physical visits can be eliminated. Cortex helps to move the buildings and spaces from offline to online and makes them accessible to our customers in real-time and on demand from anywhere. After subscribers scan their buildings, our visualization algorithms accurately infer spatial positions and depths from flat, 2D imagery captured through the scans and transform them into high- fidelity and precise digital twin models. This creates a fully automated image processing pipeline to ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality.\n",
        "•Driven by spatial data. We are a data-driven company. Each incremental capture of a space grows the richness and depth of our spatial data library. Spatial data represents the unique and idiosyncratic details that underlie and compose the buildings and spaces in the human- made environment. Cortex uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twins. We help our subscribers pinpoint the height, location and other characteristics of objects in their digital twin. Our sophisticated algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. For instance, property developers can assess the amount of natural heat and daylight coming from specific windows, retailers can ensure each store layout is up to the same level of code and brand requirements, and factories can insure machinery layouts meet specifications and location guidelines. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, our spatial data library is the clearinghouse for information about the built world.\n",
        "•Powered by AI and ML. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies effectively utilize spatial data to create a robust virtual experience that is dynamic, realistic, interactive, informative and permits multiple viewing angles. AI and ML also make costly cameras unnecessary for everyday scans—subscribers can now scan their spaces by simply tapping a button on their smartphones. As a result, Matterport is a device agnostic platform, helping us more rapidly scale and drive towards our mission of digitizing and indexing the built world.\n",
        "Our value proposition to subscribers is designed to serve the entirety of the digital building lifecycle, from design and build to maintenance and operations, promotion, sale, lease, insure, repair, restore, secure and finance. As a result, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue with our subscribers as we help them to discover opportunities to drive short- and long-term return on investment by taking their buildings and spaces from offline to online across their portfolios of properties.\n",
        "Ubiquitous Capture\n",
        "Matterport has become the standard for 3D space capture. Our technology platform empowers subscribers worldwide to quickly, easily and accurately digitize, customize and manage interactive and dimensionally accurate digital twins of their buildings and spaces.\n",

Capturing 3D data up to 100 meters away at less than 20 seconds per sweep, Pro3’s ultra-fast, high-precision LiDAR sensor can run for hours and takes millions of measurements in any conditions.\n",
        "•Matterport Pro2 is our proprietary 3D camera that has been used to capture millions of spaces around the world with a high degree of fidelity, precision, speed and simplicity. Capable of capturing buildings more than 500,000 square feet in size, it has become the camera of choice for many residential, commercial, industrial and large-scale properties.\n",
        "•360 Cameras. Matterport supports a selection of 360 cameras available in the market. These affordable, pocket sized devices deliver precision captures with high fidelity and are appropriate for capturing smaller homes, condos, short-term rentals, apartments, and more. The spherical lens image capture technology of these devices gives Cortex robust, detailed image data to transform panoramas into our industry-leading digital twins.\n",
        "•LEICA BLK360. Through our partnership with Leica, our 3D reconstruction technology and our AI powered software engine, Cortex, transform this powerful LiDAR camera into an ultra-precise capture device for creating Matterport digital twins. It is the solution of choice for AEC professionals when exacting precision is required.\n",
        "•Smartphone Capture. Our capture apps are commercially available for both iOS and Android. Matterport’s smartphone capture solution has democratized 3D capture, making it easy and accessible for anyone to digitize buildings and spaces with a recent iPhone device since the initial introduction of Matterport for iPhone in May 2020. In April 2021, we announced the official release of the Android Capture app, giving Android users the ability to quickly and easily capture buildings and spaces in immersive 3D.

        "Cortex and 3D Reconstruction (the Matterport Digital Twin)\n",
        "With a spatial data library, as of December 31, 2022, of approximately 9.2 million spaces under management, representing approximately 28 billion captured square feet of space, we use our advanced ML and DL technologies to algorithmically transform the spatial data we capture into an accurate 3D digital reproduction of any physical space. This intelligent, automated 3D reconstruction is made possible by Cortex, our AI-powered software engine that includes a deep learning neural network that uses our spatial data library to understand how a building or space is divided into floors and rooms, where the doorways and openings are located, and what types of rooms are present, such that those forms are compiled and aligned with dimensional accuracy into a dynamic, photorealistic digital twin. Other components of Cortex include AI-powered computer vision technologies to identify and classify the contents inside a building or space, and object recognition technologies to identify and segment everything from furnishings and equipment to doors, windows, light fixtures, fire suppression sprinklers and fire escapes. Our highly scalable artificial intelligence platform enables our subscribers to tap into powerful, enhanced building data and insights at the click of a button.\n",
        "\n",

More than just raw training data, Matterport’s datasets allow us to develop new neural network architectures and evaluate them against user behavior and real-world data in millions of situations.\n",
        "•Deep learning: Connecting and optimizing the detailed neural network data architecture of each space is key to creating robust, highly accurate 3D digital twins. Cortex evaluates and optimizes each 3D model against Matterport’s rich spatial data aggregated from millions of buildings and spaces and the human annotations of those data provided by tens of thousands of subscribers worldwide. Cortex’s evaluative abilities and its data-driven optimization of 3D reconstruction yield consistent, high-precision results across a wide array of building configurations, spaces and environments.\n",
        "•Dynamic 3D reconstruction: Creating precise 3D spatial data at scale from 2D visuals and static images requires a combination of photorealistic, detailed data from multiple viewpoints and millions of spaces that train and optimize Cortex’s neural network and learning capabilities for improved 3D reconstruction of any space. Cortex’s capabilities combined with real-time spatial alignment algorithms in our 3D capture technology create an intuitive “preview” of any work in progress, allowing subscribers to work with their content interactively and in real-time.\n",
        "•Computer vision: Cortex enables a suite of powerful features to enhance the value of digital twins. These include automatic measurements for rooms or objects in a room, automatic 2D-from-3D high-definition photo gallery creation, auto face blurring for privacy protection, custom videos, walkthroughs, auto room labeling and object recognition.\n",
        "•Advanced image processing: Matterport’s computational photography algorithms create a fully automated image processing pipeline to help ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality. Our patented technology makes 3D capture as simple as pressing a single button. Matterport’s software and technology manage the remaining steps, including white balance and camera-specific color correction, high dynamic range tone mapping, de-noising, haze removal, sharpening, saturation and other adjustments to improve image quality.\n",
        "Spatial Data and AI-Powered Insights\n",
        "Every Matterport digital twin contains extensive information about a building, room or physical space. The data uses our AI-powered Cortex engine. In addition to the Matterport digital twin itself, our spatial data consists of precision building geometry and structural detail, building contents, fixtures and condition, along with high-definition imagery and photorealistic detail from many vantage points in a space. Cortex employs a technique we call deep spatial indexing. Deep spatial indexing uses artificial intelligence, computer vision and deep learning to identify and convey important details about each space, its structure and its contents with precision and fidelity. We have created a robust spatial data standard that enables Matterport subscribers to harness an interoperable digital system of record for any building.\n",
        "In addition to creating a highly interactive digital experience for subscribers through the construction of digital twins, we ask ourselves two questions for every subscriber: (1) what is important about their building or physical space and (2) what learnings and insights can we deliver for this space? Our AI-powered Cortex engine helps us answer these questions using our spatial data library to provide aggregated property trends and operational and valuation insights. Moreover, as the Matterport platform ecosystem continues to expand, our subscribers, partners and other third-party developers can bring their own tools to further the breadth and depth of insights they can harvest from our rich spatial data layer.\n",

Matterport is democratizing the 3D capture experience, making high-fidelity and high-accuracy 3D digital twins readily available for any building type and any subscriber need in the property life cycle. While there are other 3D capture solution providers, very few can produce true, dimensionally accurate 3D results, and fewer still can automatically create a final product in photorealistic 3D, and at global scale. This expansive capture technology offering would not be possible without our rich spatial data library available to train the AI-powered Cortex engine to automatically generate accurate digital twins from photos captured with a smartphone or 360 camera.\n",

        "Item 1. Business\n",
        "Our Company\n",
        "Matterport is leading the digitization and datafication of the built world. We believe the digital transformation of the built world will fundamentally change the way people interact with buildings and the physical spaces around them.\n",
        "Since its founding in 2011, Matterport’s pioneering technology has set the standard for digitizing, accessing and managing buildings, spaces and places online. Our platform’s innovative software, spatial data-driven data science, and 3D capture technology have broken down the barriers that have kept the largest asset class in the world, buildings and physical spaces, offline and underutilized for many years. We believe the digitization and datafication of the built world will continue to unlock significant operational efficiencies and property values, and that Matterport is the platform to lead this enormous global transformation.\n",
        "The world is rapidly moving from offline to online. Digital transformation has made a powerful and lasting impact across every business and industry today. According to International Data Corporation, or IDC, over $6.8 trillion of direct investments will be made on digital transformation from 2020 to 2023, the global digital transformation spending is forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion in 2026 with a five-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 16.3%, and digital twin investments are expected to have a five-year CAGR of 35.2%. With this secular shift, there is also growing demand for the built world to transition from physical to digital. Nevertheless, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain offline and undigitized. The global building stock, estimated by Savills to be $327 trillion in total property value as of 2021, remains largely offline today, and we estimate that less than 0.1% is penetrated by digital transformation.\n",
        "Matterport was among the first to recognize the increasing need for digitization of the built world and the power of spatial data, the unique details underlying buildings and spaces, in facilitating the understanding of buildings and spaces. In the past, technology advanced physical road maps to the data-rich, digital maps and location services we all rely on today. Matterport now digitizes buildings, creating a data-rich environment to vastly increase our understanding and the full potential of each and every space we capture. Just as we can instantly, at the touch of a button, learn the fastest route from one city to another or locate the nearest coffee shops, Matterport’s spatial data for buildings unlocks a rich set of insights and learnings about properties and spaces worldwide. In addition, just as the geo-spatial mapping platforms of today have opened their mapping data to industry to create new business models such as ridesharing, e-commerce, food delivery marketplaces, and even short-term rental and home sharing, open access to Matterport’s structured spatial data is enabling new opportunities and business models for hospitality, facilities management, insurance, construction, real estate and retail, among others.\n",
        "We believe the total addressable market opportunity for digitizing the built world is over $240 billion, and could be as high as $1 trillion as the market matures at scale. This is based on our analysis, modeling and understanding of the global building stock of over 4 billion properties and 20 billion spaces in the world today. With the help of artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning (“ML”) and deep learning (“DL”) technologies, we believe that, with the additional monetization opportunities from powerful spatial data-driven property insights and analytics, the total addressable market for the digitization and datafication of the built world will reach more than $1 trillion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our spatial data platform and capture of digital twins deliver value across a diverse set of industries and use cases. Large retailers can manage thousands of store locations remotely, real estate agencies can provide virtual open houses for hundreds of properties and thousands of visitors at the same time, property developers can monitor the entirety of the construction process with greater detail and speed, and insurance companies can more precisely document and evaluate claims and underwriting assessments with efficiency and precision. Matterport delivers the critical digital experience, tools and information that matter to our subscribers about properties of virtually any size, shape, and location worldwide.\n",
        "For nearly a decade, we have been growing our spatial data platform and expanding our capabilities in order to create the most detailed, accurate, and data-rich digital twins available. Moreover, our 3D reconstruction process is fully automated, allowing our solution to scale with equal precision to millions of buildings and spaces of any type, shape, and size in the world. The universal applicability of our service provides Matterport significant scale and reach across diverse verticals and any geography. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base had grown approximately 39% to over 701,000 subscribers from 503,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2021, with our digital twins reaching more than 170 countries. We have digitized more than 28 billion square feet of space across multiple industries, representing significant scale and growth over the rest of the market.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we continue to transform buildings into data worldwide, we are extending our spatial data platform to further transform property planning, development, management and intelligence for our subscribers across industries to become the de facto building and business intelligence engine for the built world. We believe the demand for spatial data and resulting insights for enterprises, businesses and institutions across industries, including real estate, architecture, engineering and construction (“AEC”), retail, insurance and government, will continue to grow rapidly.\n",
        "We believe digitization and datafication represent a tremendous greenfield opportunity for growth across this massive category and asset class. From the early stages of design and development to marketing, operations, insurance and building repair and maintenance, our platform’s software and technology provide subscribers critical tools and insights to drive cost savings, increase revenues and optimally manage their buildings and spaces. We believe that hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized utilization and operating efficiencies in the built world can be unlocked through the power of our spatial data platform. Our platform and data solutions have universal applicability across industries and building categories, giving Matterport a significant advantage as we can address the entirety of this large market opportunity and increase the value of what we believe to be the largest asset class in the world.\n",
        "With a demonstrated track record of delivering value to our subscribers, our offerings include software subscription, data licensing, services and product hardware. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base included over 24% of Fortune 1000 companies, with less than 10% of our total revenue generated from our top 10 subscribers. We expect more than 80% of our revenue to come from our software subscription and data license solutions by 2025. Our innovative 3D capture products, the Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras, have played an integral part in shaping the 3D building and property visualization ecosystem. The Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras have driven adoption of our solutions and have generated the unique high-quality and scaled data set that has enabled Cortex, our proprietary AI software engine, to become the pioneering engine for digital twin creation. With this data advantage initially spurred by the Pro2 Camera, we have developed a capture device agnostic platform that scales and can generate new building and property insights for our subscribers across industries and geographies.\n",
        "We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our gross profit decreased by $8.1 million or 14%, to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022. Our ability to retain and grow the subscription revenue generated by our existing subscribers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. We track our performance in this area by measuring our net dollar expansion rate from the same set of customers across comparable periods. Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform.\n",
        "Our Industry and Market Opportunity\n",
        "Today, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain undigitized. We estimate our current serviceable addressable market includes approximately 1.3 billion spaces worldwide, primarily from the real estate and travel and hospitality sectors. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, we are continuing to penetrate the global building stock and expand our footprint across various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management, retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. We estimate our total addressable market to be more than 4 billion buildings and 20 billion spaces globally, yielding a more than $240 billion market opportunity. We believe that as Matterport’s unique spatial data library and property data services continue to grow, this opportunity could increase to more than $1 trillion based on the size of the building stock and the untapped value creation available to buildings worldwide. The constraints created by the COVID-19 pandemic have only reinforced and accelerated the importance of our scaled 3D capture solution that we have developed for diverse industries and markets over the past decade.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our Spatial Data Platform\n",
        "Overview\n",
        "Our technology platform uses spatial data collected from a wide variety of digital capture devices to transform physical buildings and spaces into dimensionally accurate, photorealistic digital twins that provide our subscribers access to previously unavailable building information and insights.\n",
        "As a first mover in this massive market for nearly a decade, we have developed and scaled our industry-leading 3D reconstruction technology powered by Cortex, our proprietary AI-driven software engine that uses machine learning to recreate a photorealistic, 3D virtual representation of an entire building structure, including contents, equipment and furnishings. The finished product is a detailed and dynamic replication of the physical space that can be explored, analyzed and customized from a web browser on any device, including smartphones. The power to manage even large-scale commercial buildings is in the palm of each subscriber’s hands, made possible by our advanced technology and breakthrough innovations across our entire spatial data technology stack.\n",
        "Key elements of our spatial data platform include:\n",
        "•Bringing offline buildings online. Traditionally, our customers needed to conduct in-person site visits to understand and assess their buildings and spaces. While photographs and floor plans can be helpful, these forms of two-dimensional (“2D”) representation have limited information and tend to be static and rigid, and thus lack the interactive element critical to a holistic understanding of each building and space. With the AI-powered capabilities of Cortex, our proprietary AI software, representation of physical objects is no longer confined to static 2D images and physical visits can be eliminated. Cortex helps to move the buildings and spaces from offline to online and makes them accessible to our customers in real-time and on demand from anywhere. After subscribers scan their buildings, our visualization algorithms accurately infer spatial positions and depths from flat, 2D imagery captured through the scans and transform them into high- fidelity and precise digital twin models. This creates a fully automated image processing pipeline to ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality.\n",
        "•Driven by spatial data. We are a data-driven company. Each incremental capture of a space grows the richness and depth of our spatial data library. Spatial data represents the unique and idiosyncratic details that underlie and compose the buildings and spaces in the human- made environment. Cortex uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twins. We help our subscribers pinpoint the height, location and other characteristics of objects in their digital twin. Our sophisticated algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. For instance, property developers can assess the amount of natural heat and daylight coming from specific windows, retailers can ensure each store layout is up to the same level of code and brand requirements, and factories can insure machinery layouts meet specifications and location guidelines. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, our spatial data library is the clearinghouse for information about the built world.\n",
        "•Powered by AI and ML. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies effectively utilize spatial data to create a robust virtual experience that is dynamic, realistic, interactive, informative and permits multiple viewing angles. AI and ML also make costly cameras unnecessary for everyday scans—subscribers can now scan their spaces by simply tapping a button on their smartphones. As a result, Matterport is a device agnostic platform, helping us more rapidly scale and drive towards our mission of digitizing and indexing the built world.\n",
        "Our value proposition to subscribers is designed to serve the entirety of the digital building lifecycle, from design and build to maintenance and operations, promotion, sale, lease, insure, repair, restore, secure and finance. As a result, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue with our subscribers as we help them to discover opportunities to drive short- and long-term return on investment by taking their buildings and spaces from offline to online across their portfolios of properties.\n",
        "Ubiquitous Capture\n",
        "Matterport has become the standard for 3D space capture. Our technology platform empowers subscribers worldwide to quickly, easily and accurately digitize, customize and manage interactive and dimensionally accurate digital twins of their buildings and spaces.\n",

This provides the flexibility to capture a space of any size, scale, and complexity, at anytime and anywhere.\n",
        "•Matterport Pro3 is our newest 3D camera that scans properties faster than earlier versions to help accelerate project completion. Pro3 provides the highest accuracy scans of both indoor and outdoor spaces and is designed for speed, fidelity, versatility and accuracy. Capturing 3D data up to 100 meters away at less than 20 seconds per sweep, Pro3’s ultra-fast, high-precision LiDAR sensor can run for hours and takes millions of measurements in any conditions.\n",
        "•Matterport Pro2 is our proprietary 3D camera that has been used to capture millions of spaces around the world with a high degree of fidelity, precision, speed and simplicity. Capable of capturing buildings more than 500,000 square feet in size, it has become the camera of choice for many residential, commercial, industrial and large-scale properties.\n",
        "•360 Cameras. Matterport supports a selection of 360 cameras available in the market. These affordable, pocket sized devices deliver precision captures with high fidelity and are appropriate for capturing smaller homes, condos, short-term rentals, apartments, and more. The spherical lens image capture technology of these devices gives Cortex robust, detailed image data to transform panoramas into our industry-leading digital twins.\n",
        "•LEICA BLK360. Through our partnership with Leica, our 3D reconstruction technology and our AI powered software engine, Cortex, transform this powerful LiDAR camera into an ultra-precise capture device for creating Matterport digital twins. It is the solution of choice for AEC professionals when exacting precision is required.\n",
        "•Smartphone Capture. Our capture apps are commercially available for both iOS and Android. Matterport’s smartphone capture solution has democratized 3D capture, making it easy and accessible for anyone to digitize buildings and spaces with a recent iPhone device since the initial introduction of Matterport for iPhone in May 2020. In April 2021, we announced the official release of the Android Capture app, giving Android users the ability to quickly and easily capture buildings and spaces in immersive 3D. In February 2022, we launched Matterport Axis, a motorized mount that holds a smartphone and can be used with the Matterport Capture app to capture 3D digital twins of any physical space with increased speed, precision, and consistency.\n",
        "Cortex and 3D Reconstruction (the Matterport Digital Twin)\n",
        "With a spatial data library, as of December 31, 2022, of approximately 9.2 million spaces under management, representing approximately 28 billion captured square feet of space, we use our advanced ML and DL technologies to algorithmically transform the spatial data we capture into an accurate 3D digital reproduction of any physical space. This intelligent, automated 3D reconstruction is made possible by Cortex, our AI-powered software engine that includes a deep learning neural network that uses our spatial data library to understand how a building or space is divided into floors and rooms, where the doorways and openings are located, and what types of rooms are present, such that those forms are compiled and aligned with dimensional accuracy into a dynamic, photorealistic digital twin. Other components of Cortex include AI-powered computer vision technologies to identify and classify the contents inside a building or space, and object recognition technologies to identify and segment everything from furnishings and equipment to doors, windows, light fixtures, fire suppression sprinklers and fire escapes. Our highly scalable artificial intelligence platform enables our subscribers to tap into powerful, enhanced building data and insights at the click of a button.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Science Behind the Matterport Digital Twin: Cortex AI Highlights\n",
        "Matterport Runs on Cortex\n",
        "Cortex is our AI-powered software engine that includes a precision deep learning neural network to create digital twins of any building or space. Developed using our proprietary spatial data captured with our Pro2 and Pro3 cameras, Cortex delivers a high degree of precision and accuracy while enabling 3D capture using everyday devices.\n",
        "Generic neural networks struggle with 3D reconstruction of the real world. Matterport-optimized networks deliver more accurate and robust results. More than just raw training data, Matterport’s datasets allow us to develop new neural network architectures and evaluate them against user behavior and real-world data in millions of situations.\n",
        "•Deep learning: Connecting and optimizing the detailed neural network data architecture of each space is key to creating robust, highly accurate 3D digital twins. Cortex evaluates and optimizes each 3D model against Matterport’s rich spatial data aggregated from millions of buildings and spaces and the human annotations of those data provided by tens of thousands of subscribers worldwide. Cortex’s evaluative abilities and its data-driven optimization of 3D reconstruction yield consistent, high-precision results across a wide array of building configurations, spaces and environments.\n",
        "•Dynamic 3D reconstruction: Creating precise 3D spatial data at scale from 2D visuals and static images requires a combination of photorealistic, detailed data from multiple viewpoints and millions of spaces that train and optimize Cortex’s neural network and learning capabilities for improved 3D reconstruction of any space. Cortex’s capabilities combined with real-time spatial alignment algorithms in our 3D capture technology create an intuitive “preview” of any work in progress, allowing subscribers to work with their content interactively and in real-time.\n",
        "•Computer vision: Cortex enables a suite of powerful features to enhance the value of digital twins. These include automatic measurements for rooms or objects in a room, automatic 2D-from-3D high-definition photo gallery creation, auto face blurring for privacy protection, custom videos, walkthroughs, auto room labeling and object recognition.\n",
        "•Advanced image processing: Matterport’s computational photography algorithms create a fully automated image processing pipeline to help ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality. Our patented technology makes 3D capture as simple as pressing a single button. Matterport’s software and technology manage the remaining steps, including white balance and camera-specific color correction, high dynamic range tone mapping, de-noising, haze removal, sharpening, saturation and other adjustments to improve image quality.\n",
        "Spatial Data and AI-Powered Insights\n",
        "Every Matterport digital twin contains extensive information about a building, room or physical space. The data uses our AI-powered Cortex engine. In addition to the Matterport digital twin itself, our spatial data consists of precision building geometry and structural detail, building contents, fixtures and condition, along with high-definition imagery and photorealistic detail from many vantage points in a space. Cortex employs a technique we call deep spatial indexing. Deep spatial indexing uses artificial intelligence, computer vision and deep learning to identify and convey important details about each space, its structure and its contents with precision and fidelity. We have created a robust spatial data standard that enables Matterport subscribers to harness an interoperable digital system of record for any building.\n",
        "In addition to creating a highly interactive digital experience for subscribers through the construction of digital twins, we ask ourselves two questions for every subscriber: (1) what is important about their building or physical space and (2) what learnings and insights can we deliver for this space? Our AI-powered Cortex engine helps us answer these questions using our spatial data library to provide aggregated property trends and operational and valuation insights. Moreover, as the Matterport platform ecosystem continues to expand, our subscribers, partners and other third-party developers can bring their own tools to further the breadth and depth of insights they can harvest from our rich spatial data layer.\n",

        "Item 1. Business\n",
        "Our Company\n",
        "Matterport is leading the digitization and datafication of the built world. We believe the digital transformation of the built world will fundamentally change the way people interact with buildings and the physical spaces around them.\n",
        "Since its founding in 2011, Matterport’s pioneering technology has set the standard for digitizing, accessing and managing buildings, spaces and places online. Our platform’s innovative software, spatial data-driven data science, and 3D capture technology have broken down the barriers that have kept the largest asset class in the world, buildings and physical spaces, offline and underutilized for many years. We believe the digitization and datafication of the built world will continue to unlock significant operational efficiencies and property values, and that Matterport is the platform to lead this enormous global transformation.\n",
        "The world is rapidly moving from offline to online. Digital transformation has made a powerful and lasting impact across every business and industry today. According to International Data Corporation, or IDC, over $6.8 trillion of direct investments will be made on digital transformation from 2020 to 2023, the global digital transformation spending is forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion in 2026 with a five-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 16.3%, and digital twin investments are expected to have a five-year CAGR of 35.2%. With this secular shift, there is also growing demand for the built world to transition from physical to digital. Nevertheless, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain offline and undigitized. The global building stock, estimated by Savills to be $327 trillion in total property value as of 2021, remains largely offline today, and we estimate that less than 0.1% is penetrated by digital transformation.\n",
        "Matterport was among the first to recognize the increasing need for digitization of the built world and the power of spatial data, the unique details underlying buildings and spaces, in facilitating the understanding of buildings and spaces. In the past, technology advanced physical road maps to the data-rich, digital maps and location services we all rely on today. Matterport now digitizes buildings, creating a data-rich environment to vastly increase our understanding and the full potential of each and every space we capture. Just as we can instantly, at the touch of a button, learn the fastest route from one city to another or locate the nearest coffee shops, Matterport’s spatial data for buildings unlocks a rich set of insights and learnings about properties and spaces worldwide. In addition, just as the geo-spatial mapping platforms of today have opened their mapping data to industry to create new business models such as ridesharing, e-commerce, food delivery marketplaces, and even short-term rental and home sharing, open access to Matterport’s structured spatial data is enabling new opportunities and business models for hospitality, facilities management, insurance, construction, real estate and retail, among others.\n",
        "We believe the total addressable market opportunity for digitizing the built world is over $240 billion, and could be as high as $1 trillion as the market matures at scale. This is based on our analysis, modeling and understanding of the global building stock of over 4 billion properties and 20 billion spaces in the world today. With the help of artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning (“ML”) and deep learning (“DL”) technologies, we believe that, with the additional monetization opportunities from powerful spatial data-driven property insights and analytics, the total addressable market for the digitization and datafication of the built world will reach more than $1 trillion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our spatial data platform and capture of digital twins deliver value across a diverse set of industries and use cases. Large retailers can manage thousands of store locations remotely, real estate agencies can provide virtual open houses for hundreds of properties and thousands of visitors at the same time, property developers can monitor the entirety of the construction process with greater detail and speed, and insurance companies can more precisely document and evaluate claims and underwriting assessments with efficiency and precision. Matterport delivers the critical digital experience, tools and information that matter to our subscribers about properties of virtually any size, shape, and location worldwide.\n",
        "For nearly a decade, we have been growing our spatial data platform and expanding our capabilities in order to create the most detailed, accurate, and data-rich digital twins available. Moreover, our 3D reconstruction process is fully automated, allowing our solution to scale with equal precision to millions of buildings and spaces of any type, shape, and size in the world. The universal applicability of our service provides Matterport significant scale and reach across diverse verticals and any geography. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base had grown approximately 39% to over 701,000 subscribers from 503,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2021, with our digital twins reaching more than 170 countries. We have digitized more than 28 billion square feet of space across multiple industries, representing significant scale and growth over the rest of the market.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we continue to transform buildings into data worldwide, we are extending our spatial data platform to further transform property planning, development, management and intelligence for our subscribers across industries to become the de facto building and business intelligence engine for the built world. We believe the demand for spatial data and resulting insights for enterprises, businesses and institutions across industries, including real estate, architecture, engineering and construction (“AEC”), retail, insurance and government, will continue to grow rapidly.\n",

        "With a demonstrated track record of delivering value to our subscribers, our offerings include software subscription, data licensing, services and product hardware. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base included over 24% of Fortune 1000 companies, with less than 10% of our total revenue generated from our top 10 subscribers. We expect more than 80% of our revenue to come from our software subscription and data license solutions by 2025. Our innovative 3D capture products, the Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras, have played an integral part in shaping the 3D building and property visualization ecosystem. The Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras have driven adoption of our solutions and have generated the unique high-quality and scaled data set that has enabled Cortex, our proprietary AI software engine, to become the pioneering engine for digital twin creation. With this data advantage initially spurred by the Pro2 Camera, we have developed a capture device agnostic platform that scales and can generate new building and property insights for our subscribers across industries and geographies.\n",
        "We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our gross profit decreased by $8.1 million or 14%, to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022. Our ability to retain and grow the subscription revenue generated by our existing subscribers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. We track our performance in this area by measuring our net dollar expansion rate from the same set of customers across comparable periods. Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform.\n",
        "Our Industry and Market Opportunity\n",
        "Today, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain undigitized. We estimate our current serviceable addressable market includes approximately 1.3 billion spaces worldwide, primarily from the real estate and travel and hospitality sectors. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, we are continuing to penetrate the global building stock and expand our footprint across various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management, retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. We estimate our total addressable market to be more than 4 billion buildings and 20 billion spaces globally, yielding a more than $240 billion market opportunity. We believe that as Matterport’s unique spatial data library and property data services continue to grow, this opportunity could increase to more than $1 trillion based on the size of the building stock and the untapped value creation available to buildings worldwide. The constraints created by the COVID-19 pandemic have only reinforced and accelerated the importance of our scaled 3D capture solution that we have developed for diverse industries and markets over the past decade.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our Spatial Data Platform\n",
        "Overview\n",
        "Our technology platform uses spatial data collected from a wide variety of digital capture devices to transform physical buildings and spaces into dimensionally accurate, photorealistic digital twins that provide our subscribers access to previously unavailable building information and insights.\n",
        "As a first mover in this massive market for nearly a decade, we have developed and scaled our industry-leading 3D reconstruction technology powered by Cortex, our proprietary AI-driven software engine that uses machine learning to recreate a photorealistic, 3D virtual representation of an entire building structure, including contents, equipment and furnishings. The finished product is a detailed and dynamic replication of the physical space that can be explored, analyzed and customized from a web browser on any device, including smartphones. The power to manage even large-scale commercial buildings is in the palm of each subscriber’s hands, made possible by our advanced technology and breakthrough innovations across our entire spatial data technology stack.\n",
        "Key elements of our spatial data platform include:\n",
        "•Bringing offline buildings online. Traditionally, our customers needed to conduct in-person site visits to understand and assess their buildings and spaces. While photographs and floor plans can be helpful, these forms of two-dimensional (“2D”) representation have limited information and tend to be static and rigid, and thus lack the interactive element critical to a holistic understanding of each building and space. With the AI-powered capabilities of Cortex, our proprietary AI software, representation of physical objects is no longer confined to static 2D images and physical visits can be eliminated. Cortex helps to move the buildings and spaces from offline to online and makes them accessible to our customers in real-time and on demand from anywhere. After subscribers scan their buildings, our visualization algorithms accurately infer spatial positions and depths from flat, 2D imagery captured through the scans and transform them into high- fidelity and precise digital twin models. This creates a fully automated image processing pipeline to ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality.\n",
        "•Driven by spatial data. We are a data-driven company. Each incremental capture of a space grows the richness and depth of our spatial data library. Spatial data represents the unique and idiosyncratic details that underlie and compose the buildings and spaces in the human- made environment. Cortex uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twins. We help our subscribers pinpoint the height, location and other characteristics of objects in their digital twin. Our sophisticated algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. For instance, property developers can assess the amount of natural heat and daylight coming from specific windows, retailers can ensure each store layout is up to the same level of code and brand requirements, and factories can insure machinery layouts meet specifications and location guidelines. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, our spatial data library is the clearinghouse for information about the built world.\n",
        "•Powered by AI and ML. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies effectively utilize spatial data to create a robust virtual experience that is dynamic, realistic, interactive, informative and permits multiple viewing angles. AI and ML also make costly cameras unnecessary for everyday scans—subscribers can now scan their spaces by simply tapping a button on their smartphones. As a result, Matterport is a device agnostic platform, helping us more rapidly scale and drive towards our mission of digitizing and indexing the built world.\n",
        "Our value proposition to subscribers is designed to serve the entirety of the digital building lifecycle, from design and build to maintenance and operations, promotion, sale, lease, insure, repair, restore, secure and finance. As a result, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue with our subscribers as we help them to discover opportunities to drive short- and long-term return on investment by taking their buildings and spaces from offline to online across their portfolios of properties.\n",
        "Ubiquitous Capture\n",

        "Cortex and 3D Reconstruction (the Matterport Digital Twin)\n",
        "With a spatial data library, as of December 31, 2022, of approximately 9.2 million spaces under management, representing approximately 28 billion captured square feet of space, we use our advanced ML and DL technologies to algorithmically transform the spatial data we capture into an accurate 3D digital reproduction of any physical space. This intelligent, automated 3D reconstruction is made possible by Cortex, our AI-powered software engine that includes a deep learning neural network that uses our spatial data library to understand how a building or space is divided into floors and rooms, where the doorways and openings are located, and what types of rooms are present, such that those forms are compiled and aligned with dimensional accuracy into a dynamic, photorealistic digital twin. Other components of Cortex include AI-powered computer vision technologies to identify and classify the contents inside a building or space, and object recognition technologies to identify and segment everything from furnishings and equipment to doors, windows, light fixtures, fire suppression sprinklers and fire escapes. Our highly scalable artificial intelligence platform enables our subscribers to tap into powerful, enhanced building data and insights at the click of a button.\n",
        "\n",

Our patented technology makes 3D capture as simple as pressing a single button. Matterport’s software and technology manage the remaining steps, including white balance and camera-specific color correction, high dynamic range tone mapping, de-noising, haze removal, sharpening, saturation and other adjustments to improve image quality.\n",
        "Spatial Data and AI-Powered Insights\n",
        "Every Matterport digital twin contains extensive information about a building, room or physical space. The data uses our AI-powered Cortex engine. In addition to the Matterport digital twin itself, our spatial data consists of precision building geometry and structural detail, building contents, fixtures and condition, along with high-definition imagery and photorealistic detail from many vantage points in a space. Cortex employs a technique we call deep spatial indexing. Deep spatial indexing uses artificial intelligence, computer vision and deep learning to identify and convey important details about each space, its structure and its contents with precision and fidelity. We have created a robust spatial data standard that enables Matterport subscribers to harness an interoperable digital system of record for any building.\n",
        "In addition to creating a highly interactive digital experience for subscribers through the construction of digital twins, we ask ourselves two questions for every subscriber: (1) what is important about their building or physical space and (2) what learnings and insights can we deliver for this space? Our AI-powered Cortex engine helps us answer these questions using our spatial data library to provide aggregated property trends and operational and valuation insights. Moreover, as the Matterport platform ecosystem continues to expand, our subscribers, partners and other third-party developers can bring their own tools to further the breadth and depth of insights they can harvest from our rich spatial data layer.\n",

The Pro2 camera was foundational to our spatial data advantage, and we have expanded that advantage with an array of Matterport-enabled third-party capture devices. In August 2022, we launched and began shipment of our Pro3 Camera along with major updates to our industry-leading digital twin cloud platform. The Matterport Pro3 Camera is an advanced 3D capture device, which includes faster boot time, swappable batteries, and a lighter design. The Pro3 camera can perform both indoors and outdoors and is designed for speed, fidelity, versatility and accuracy. Along with our Pro2 Camera, we expect that future sales of our Pro3 Camera will continue to drive increased adoption of our solutions. Matterport is democratizing the 3D capture experience, making high-fidelity and high-accuracy 3D digital twins readily available for any building type and any subscriber need in the property life cycle. While there are other 3D capture solution providers, very few can produce true, dimensionally accurate 3D results, and fewer still can automatically create a final product in photorealistic 3D, and at global scale. This expansive capture technology offering would not be possible without our rich spatial data library available to train the AI-powered Cortex engine to automatically generate accurate digital twins from photos captured with a smartphone or 360 camera.\n",
