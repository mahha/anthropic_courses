    "このレッスンでは、promptfoo を使って **カスタムのモデル採点（model-graded）評価** を作る方法を学びます。まずはシンプルな目標から始めます：技術的に複雑で長い Wikipedia 記事を、小学生（grade school）向けに短く分かりやすく要約できるプロンプトを書きたい。\n",
    "\n",
    "例えば [畳み込みニューラルネットワーク（Convolutional neural network）の Wikipedia 記事](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) 全文が入力として与えられたとき、次のような平易な要約が欲しい、というイメージです：\n",
    "\n",
    "> Convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, are a special type of computer program that can learn to recognize images and patterns. They work a bit like the human brain, using layers of artificial \"neurons\" to process information.\n",
    "CNNs are really good at tasks like identifying objects in pictures or recognizing faces. They do this by breaking down images into smaller pieces and looking for important features, kind of like putting together a puzzle.\n",
    "What makes CNNs special is that they can learn these features on their own by looking at lots of examples. This allows them to get better and better at recognizing things, sometimes even matching human-level performance.\n",
    "Scientists and engineers use CNNs for all sorts of cool applications, like helping self-driving cars see the road, finding new medicines, or even teaching computers to play games like chess and Go.\n",
    "\n",
    "プロンプトの有効性を評価するために、要約結果を次の3つの指標で採点するカスタムのモデル採点アサーションを書きます：\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conciseness（1〜5）：できるだけ簡潔か？\n",
    "* Accuracy（1〜5）：元記事に照らして完全に正確か？\n",
    "* Tone（1〜5）：技術的背景のない小学生向けとして適切なトーンか？\n",
