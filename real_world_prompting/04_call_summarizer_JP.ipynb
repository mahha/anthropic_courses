    "このレッスンでは、実務でよくある「要約」ユースケース向けに、複雑なプロンプトを書きます。具体的には、カスタマーサービスの通話記録（call transcript）を要約します。\n",
    "\n",
    "目的は、サポートチームの有効性を評価するための **有用で構造化されたデータ** として、通話内容をまとめることです。そのため、接続不良・言語障壁など、要約しても意味が薄い通話は除外したいです。\n",
    "\n",
    "ここでは、スマートホーム機器を販売する架空企業「Acme Corporation」で働いていると想像してください。同社は毎日何百件ものサポート通話を扱っており、会話を素早く構造化データへ変換したい、という状況です。\n",
    "\n",
    "重要な考慮点：\n",
    "* 通話は短いものも長いものもある\n",
    "* Wi‑Fi接続の簡単な問題から、複雑な故障まで多様な問い合わせがある\n",
    "* 後で分析しやすいよう、要約は特定フォーマットで欲しい\n",
    "* 個人情報は要約に含めないよう注意する\n",
    "\n",
    "これまでに扱ったベストプラクティスに沿って進めます：\n",
    "* system prompt で前提と役割を定める\n",
    "* 最高性能を出しやすい構造でプロンプトを組む\n",
    "* 明確な指示と望ましい出力を定義する\n",

    "このレッスンでは、カスタマーサポート通話記録を要約する複雑なプロンプトを作るプロセスを一通り見ました。使ったテクニックを振り返ります：\n",

    "* **Structured Input**：通話記録を XML タグで冒頭に配置\n",
    "* **Clear Instructions**：注目点と出力の作り方を詳細に指示\n",
    "* **Output Formatting**：JSON 構造を指定し、一貫してパースしやすい出力に\n",

    "これらにより、多様な通話に対して構造化要約を作りつつ、エッジケースも適切に扱えるプロンプトになりました。このアプローチは要約以外の複雑なユースケースにも応用できます。\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** ただし、このプロンプトはまだ本番投入できる状態ではありません。現状は少数例の目視確認に基づくプロトタイプです。実運用の通話は多様で予測不能なので、定量メトリクスを伴う包括的な評価（evals）が不可欠です。データ駆動の堅牢な評価が、良さそうな試作品と信頼できる本番品質の間のギャップを埋めます。\n"
